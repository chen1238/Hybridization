Host:    ruirui (AVX2, FMA3, 1006 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s ../Mit.mafft.trimal.fasta -pre Mit -m MFP -B 1000
Seed:    556717 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Sat Jun  8 20:11:38 2024
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (64 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 64 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file ../Mit.mafft.trimal.fasta ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
Alignment has 350 sequences with 16289 columns, 1755 distinct patterns
1642 parsimony-informative, 1120 singleton sites, 13527 constant sites
