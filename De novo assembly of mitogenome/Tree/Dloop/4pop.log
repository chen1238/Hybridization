Host:    ruirui (AVX2, FMA3, 1006 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s Dloop.mafft.trimal.fasta -pre 4pop -m MFP -B 1000
Seed:    962456 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Sat Jun  8 20:35:37 2024
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (64 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 64 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file Dloop.mafft.trimal.fasta ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
Alignment has 349 sequences with 872 columns, 138 distinct patterns
100 parsimony-informative, 41 singleton sites, 731 constant sites
